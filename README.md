### Download

You can get the latest version in the ['Releases' section](https://github.com/VenoMKO/TMM/releases).

### Installation

1. Download and extract the TMM.
2. Start the TMM.exe.
3. Specify your game folder(e.g. D:\Games\Gameforge\tera\Client\S1Game).

### Installing/Adding mods

To install a composite mod click the Add button and select a GPK mod.
TMM will copy the GPK to your CookedPC folder and patch the CompositePackageMapper.dat so the game will load a modded GPK instead of the original one.
> After adding mods you can close the TMM. You don't need to start it every time you want to play Tera.

> **Notice:** TMM is necessery only for composite mods. Simple mods like `TexturedFonts.gpk` can be installed the old way by copying the GPK to `_Mods` folder.
